# 🏷️ TUJ Yard Sale

### 🛒 A community marketplace built by TUJ students, for TUJ students.

This project was originally developed by my team and I during the **TUJ Fall Hackathon**.  
This fork reflects my continued work, including front-end improvements, UI refinements, and added functionality for continued learning and development.

## 🌟Overview

**TUJ Yard Sale** is a web-based platform that allows students at Temple University Japan to:

- 🛍️ Browse items listed by other students
- 💬 Contact sellers directly
- 💼 Post items for sale, including photos and descriptions
- ♻️ Promote reuse and sustainability within the student community

The goal is to create a **safe, localized, and easy-to-use marketplace** tailored specifically to the TUJ environment.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

| Area | Tools Used |
|------|------------|
| Front-End | **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** |
| UI / Styling | **Google Fonts**, **Font Awesome** |
| Data Handling | **localStorage** (temporary client-side storage) |

## 🧭 Future Improvements / Next Steps

I plan to continue expanding functionality, including:

- ✅ User authentication (secure login system)
- ✅ Real database storage instead of localStorage
- 🗑️ Sellers being able to **delete** or **mark items as sold**
- 💬 In-app messaging or chat-like contact system
- 📱 More complete responsive mobile layout
- 💰 Search and filter by **price range**

These improvements align with my interests in **front-end development** and **expanding into data science**.
